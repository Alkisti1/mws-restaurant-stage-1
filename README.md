#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, I tool a static design that lacked accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### Specification

I was provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code had a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also dodn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it didn't work offline at all. My job was to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.

### To start the app!

1. Download the project or fork it through github

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
3. Enjoy the app
